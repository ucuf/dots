# The deadzone is an area that makes the mouse act like leaving the window.
# Movement there won't make the OSC show up and it will hide immediately if the
# mouse enters it.
# The deadzone starts at the window border opposite to the OSC and the size
# controls how much of the window it will span. Values between 0.0
# and 1.0, where 0 means the OSC will always popup with mouse movement in the
# window, and 1 means the OSC will only show up when the mouse hovers it.
